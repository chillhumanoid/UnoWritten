# Version History(newest first)
## 1.2.0.0
created user profiles! This keeps track of 13 statistics of your playtime: Full games played, full games won, hands played, amount of times uno called, hands won, each special card(draw 2,4, wild, reverse, skip), cards drawn(via draw card), Cards forced drawn(via penalties) and the amount of penalties. Saved automatically constantly, so even if you close the game midway through your stats save(your game however, will not). I've also split up the menu so there are 4 seperate screens. The main menu has select user and exit, the select user menu allows you to select a user or create a new one. the user menu has play, stats, select a different user(or back really) and delete user(will have you confirm). 

From the stat page you can also reset your stats. 

Please do not move the Users folder from the Uno folder, or change anything in either txt file.

Look out for my next project: Cribbage.
## 1.1.1.3
Fixed some final things. Skip works all the time, as do reverse's. Added some more names. Fixed some spelling errors. 
made it easier to tell you selected an unplayable card. Everything from here will be small updates. will start working on another project soon. i'll keep you all updated. 
## 1.1.1.2
fixed a lot of bugs with the ability to set names. shouldn't do duplicate names now. will add more names later. 
## 1.1.1.0
Added the ability to set names
## 1.1.0.0
Another update! 
This update comes with a rewrite of all the code, thus the new github repo
it also comes with the ability to play a quick game, or a normal game with scoring
## 1.0.2.0
Second update!
This update makes it so that it seems more like the computer is thinking. 
i've also upgraded how it displays what card a computer played, and thus got rid of the discard pile print out after every turn.
This creates a nicer looking command prompt :)
## 1.0.1.0
First update since I released a fully working version!!
This update allows you to specify how many computers you want to face(between 1 and 3)
## 1.0.0.1 
I am an idiot. Fixed that. sorta.
## 1.0.0.0
Fixed various problems, including an issue where changing the discard pile to draw pile dind't work 100%. In addition, when it did change the piles, it wouldn't change the wild cards back to "any". There is no more issue as far as I can tell on 100 simulations of one card ruling the world(all you could draw was the one card). Fixed an issue where if you entered a number too large, it broke the game.

Again, as far as I can tell, this is the final version of the command line version of the game. I do plan on creating it in other languages. My first goal is python. then C#. once i have c# I will create a GUI version of the game. I might do that with java but that is not a current priority. 

It's been fun. Thank you for watching my streams. If you notice any more bugs, please let me know.

## 0.1.0.0
Got rid of mac version as my script did NOT work. Working AI.
## 0.0.5.1
fixed problem where it wouldn't allow multiple digit integers
## 0.0.5.0
Most likely my last update before I add some form of AI. I fixed the draw pile. If it gets lower than 4 cards, it will take the discard pile and shuffle it and make it the draw pile. I also added a way for player to call uno themselves. if they call uno falsely, or they forget to call uno, it will result in a draw 2 penalty. 
## 0.0.4.0
Drawing a card follows Uno rules. Now you can draw a card if you can't play any other card, then you can see if you can play that card
If you can't play that card the option for draw a card turns into "End Turn". The drawn card will be at spot 1. 
## 0.0.3.0
Fixed problem where entering the wrong input results in game crash
Made it so you can type in just the first letter of the color you want to pick for wilds. 
## 0.0.2.3
fixed windows version so that it doesn't close out command prompt when a player has won.
## 0.0.2.2 
fixed how card shuffling works to allow for future "play again" option
## 0.0.2.1
Fixed a problem where wild cards would keep adding on to each player
## 0.0.2.0
Fixed wild cards and draw 2/4 to follow official Uno rules. 
## 0.0.1.2
fixed some minor bugs relating to the very early version
## 0.0.1.1
Added a title to the top
